# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction Using Ensemble Machine Learning

Predicting whether a flight will be delayed based on historical data, using ensemble models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Stacking. This project was built as part of the **DevifyX Machine Learning Assignment**.

---

## 📌 Objective

Develop a machine learning model to predict **flight delays** using historical flight data and contextual features (e.g., time, route, carrier). The project leverages **ensemble learning** to improve accuracy and robustness.
